.DS_Store - is a file exclusive to macOS that stores custom attributes of the folder it's in (this is not needed to be shared).

target/ - target folder is ignored because users can always build the project again (in their own OS) - which saves space and avoids crashes.

.idea/workspace.xml - contains user-specific Intellij stuff which doesn't need to be shared.
