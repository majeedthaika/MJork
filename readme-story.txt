You are an incoming 568 freshman coming into the CS Department in MUIC.

You must battle the frightening monsters (Ajarns) in their lairs ('fun' classes) on your way to the ultimate treasure (graduation). You can interact with fun NPCs (like P'Tow and Bossy), and choose your own path. Your score is given by your cGPA.

<Lvl 2>
-Principles of Mathematics (Aj.Aram)
You should focus a bit more academically and make sure you do your homeworks often. You can still work on your building your other attributes.

<Lvl 3>
-Data Structure & Discrete Maths (Boss: Aj.Kanat and Aj.Piti)
You should use the relationships you built to ask for help, and study a lot to pass this level (by beating the double boss battle on midterm and final).
